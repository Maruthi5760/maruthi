AI vs AI Zombie Survival - Game Agent Explanation

This simulation features two types of AI-controlled agents: Humans and Zombies, each with distinct behaviors and decision-making processes.

Human AI Agent
 Core Behaviors:
1. Self-Preservation:
   - Humans maintain a "fear level" based on zombie proximity (0-100 scale)
   - When fear > 70, they flee to the nearest safe zone
   - Health bars (100 HP) visually indicate their condition

2. Combat System:
   - Humans can shoot at zombies when they're within 150 pixels
   - Bullet trajectory includes slight inaccuracy that increases with distance
   - Limited ammo (30 rounds) with reload mechanics
   - Health decreases when touched by zombies (1 HP per collision)

3. Pathfinding:
   - Uses A* algorithm to navigate around obstacles
   - Recalculates path every 30 frames or when path is empty
   - Grid-based system with 20px nodes for efficient path calculation

4. Movement:
   - Normal speed: 2.5 pixels/frame
   - Sprites rotate to face movement direction
   - Wanders randomly when no immediate threats

Zombie AI Agent

 Core Behaviors:
1. Hunting Instinct:
   - Always chases the nearest human
   - Speed increases by aggression multiplier (0.5-1.5x) when close to humans
   - Base speed: 1.5 pixels/frame

2. Persistence:
   - Uses A* pathfinding to navigate around obstacles
   - Blood splatter effects show damage taken
   - Lower health (30 HP) than humans but spawn continuously

3. Infection Mechanism:
   - When a human's health reaches 0, they turn into a new zombie
   - Zombie sprites visually distinct with green tint and scars

 Game Systems

1. Bullet Physics:
   - Travel at 10 pixels/frame
   - Can hit zombies (10 damage) or obstacles
   - Feature visible trajectories with proper rotation

2. Environment:
   - Obstacles block movement (walls, rubble)
   - Safe zones provide human refuge
   - Grid system enables efficient pathfinding

3. Game Progression:
   - Zombies spawn continuously (every 60 frames)
   - 60-second timer determines game duration
   - Humans win if any survive the time limit
   - Zombies win if all humans are infected

The simulation demonstrates emergent AI behaviors through:
- Human fear responses leading to strategic retreats
- Zombie swarming behavior around targets
- Dynamic combat interactions
- Pathfinding around complex obstacles

Both agent types use similar A* pathfinding but apply it differently based on their objectives, creating an interesting predator-prey dynamic.
